# ladder_project

This project incorporates the electronic components of an interactive home-cage environment for mice. The homecage utilizes Arduino microcontrolers.
The project is designed to capture 1) movements of a mouse on a ladder and 2) feeding behavior of the mouse.
The ladder utilizes the Adafruit MPR121 capacitive touch sensor with STEMMAQT connector (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1982) to sense when the mouse is touching individual rungs of the ladder.
The feeding behavior is monitored using a device called FED3, which was developed by Alexei Kravitz (https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3_library/wiki).
